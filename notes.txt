- fix folder structure, put everything in /src. discord_controller can become an initaliseDiscord function (only export is that function), items_controller will become the ItemsSession class only. also rename the utils functions to controllers (and have a /controllers folder inside /src)
- encapsulate scraping to a scraping_utils file. this way the items_controller logic is encapsualted and the varying scraping part (url and loading), can be encapsualted as well
- fetch the number of results and use that to calculate if the item index is at the end. if it is, block the next button
- buttons to go back/forward by 10
- investigate having a list of options for category rather than a string
- gracefully handle no image
- set the timeout to be nice
